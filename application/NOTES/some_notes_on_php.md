# Notes on PHP

- All variables start with a $
- PHP is loosely typed casting is infrequently used
- PHP does have support for strongly typed variables

# The Laravel Framework
- Uses the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern
-- Models are used to asbtract database access
-- Controllers hold the so called business logic of the application, processing user data, interacting with the models and passing data to the views.
-- views contain the HTML, CSS & JS, some contain logic to format data from passed from the controllers
